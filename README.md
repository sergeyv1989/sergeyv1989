### Nice to meet you, I'm Sergey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with over 3 years of experience, whoâ€™s currently developing stock trading algorithms and infrastructures at Sapphire.

My passion for state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms was ignited after completing a physics MSc, wherein I published a paper on theoretical quantum optics. I then worked at the Weizmann Institute, where I published a paper on utilizing deep learning for discovering new particles. Then I continued to Veego, where I was fully responsible for developing all ML projects, which resulted in 5 pending patents on computer networks solutions.
