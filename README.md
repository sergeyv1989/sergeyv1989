### Nice to meet you, I'm Sergey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with over 3 years of experience, whoâ€™s skilled in machine & deep learning, statistics, and python.

Currently, Iâ€™m fully responsible for developing all machine learning projects at Veego, bringing diverse computer network problems from idea to production, which resulted in 5 pending patents.

Previously, I worked at the Weizmann Institute, where I published a paper on utilizing deep learning for discovering new particles. In addition, I hold a physics MSc with a paper on theoretical quantum optics.
