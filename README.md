I am a data scientist whoâ€™s guided by a passion for optimization, in all walks of life. I'm looking for a challenging position in an environment of mutual enrichment.

Currently, I am fully responsible for all machine learning projects at Veego, covering varied problems and models, which resulted in 5 pending patents. In addition, I hold a physics MSc and have 2 papers published, on discovering new particles by utilizing deep learning and on theoretical quantum optics.
