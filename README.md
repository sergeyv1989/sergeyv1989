### Hi everyone, I'm Sergey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist whoâ€™s guided by a passion for optimization, in all walks of life. I'm looking for a challenging position in an environment of mutual enrichment.
Currently, Iâ€™m fully responsible for all machine learning projects at Veego, handling diverse problems and models, which resulted in 5 pending patents. Previously, I worked at the Weizmann Institute, where I published a paper on utilizing deep learning to discover new particles. In addition, I hold a physics MSc with a paper on theoretical quantum optics.

### CV Summary:

Currently working as a machine & deep learning researcher at Veego.
