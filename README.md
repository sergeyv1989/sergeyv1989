### Hi everyone, I'm Sergey! ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist with a passion for optimization, whoâ€™s looking for a challenging position in an environment of mutual enrichment.

Currently, Iâ€™m fully responsible for all machine learning projects at Veego, bringing diverse computer network problems from idea to product, which resulted in 5 pending patents.

Previously, I worked at the Weizmann Institute, where I published a paper on utilizing deep learning to discover new particles. In addition, I hold a physics MSc with a paper on theoretical quantum optics.
